            PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
        </h4>

        <p>
            (a) Where an officer is acting in a post at a higher
            rank, he/she should be assessed against the
            requirements at the higher rank.
        </p>
        <p>
            (b) If the appraising officer is of the same
            substantive rank (although acting in a higher rank)
            as the appraisee, he/she should discuss the report
            with the next most senior officer and submit the
            report in draft for approval. He/She should state
            that this has been done in the faired version of the
            report.
        </p>

        <h5>(1) Appraisal of Performance</h5>

        <p>
            Please assess the appraisee’s performance for each
            responsibility listed in Part 2 against the
            following ratings. No allowance should be made for
            factors such as ill health, personal problems or
            circumstances outside the officer’s control which
            may have affected the appraisee’s performance. Any
            such factors should be mentioned in Section 2 ii on
            page 7.
        </p>
        <p>Please tick the appropriate box.</p>
        <p>
            A Outstanding performance, far exceeds requirements
        </p>
        <p>
            B More than meets requirements, achieving
            consistently more than what is expected of that
            particular objective/responsibility in quality and
            quantity
        </p>
        <p>
            C Fully meets requirements, achieving in full or
            occasionally above the requirements in quality and
            quantity
        </p>
        <p>
            D Barely meets the lowest requirements with need for
            improvement
        </p>
        <p>
            E Lowest requirements not met in full, and
            performance occasionally fallen short of the
            required standard in terms of quantity or quality or
            both
        </p>
        <p>
            F Lowest requirements not met; there have been
            serious performance deficiencies
        </p>
        <p>
            “Comments on Performance” and ratings should be
            consistent with each other and supported by
            justification.

                (2) Please give an overall grading on the
                appraisee’s performance in his/her present post

            <p>
                1. Outstanding, distinguished from others in

            </p>
            <p>
                2. Very effective performance which more than
                meets requirements consistently
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Effective performance which fully meets
                requirements, and occasionally exceeds such
                requirements
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Moderate performance which barely meets the
                lowest acceptable standard with need for
                improvement
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Unsatisfactory performance with much room for
                improvement
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Poor performance which falls seriously short of
                requirements
            </p>
            <p>
                “Outstanding” grading should be given only
