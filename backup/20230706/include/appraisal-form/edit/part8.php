                The countersigning officer should decide who
                should conduct the appraisal interview. Normally
                the appraising officer should conduct the
                interview. The countersigning officer should
                complete his/her assessment before the interview.
                If, in exceptional circumstances, the appraisal
                interview cannot be conducted, the reasons should
                be stated below.
